BLENDER PLUGIN : PS3 Textures 2 one material (linking specular, normals, etc...)

## Important stuff
U have to know that this is open-source and that the plugin is kinda linked to the *[NefariousTechSupport/LombaxToes](https://github.com/NefariousTechSupport/LombaxToes)* software, I'm making this to EASILY glue EVERY textures to their specular, their normals, etc... and make the whole map exportable with the materials ready for *Unreal Engine* or any other 3D engine.
This is of course Python, because Blender is Python.
